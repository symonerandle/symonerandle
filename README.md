I remember when I was in the fourth grade and we would go to the computer lab. This was my first time ever having access to a computer
other than using the computer we had at home where we had games on floppy disk with the green screen. From that point on, I wanted more
to do with computers.  Just a few years later, we got an updated family computer. My dad showed me this age calculator in Excel that I 
later realized he programmed. Something about the array of capabilities within computers facinated me. I decided I was going to be a 
computer technologist when I grew up.

Presently, I have familiarized myself to the many subjects of technology from web developement to cloud computation. I got into creating
tools used to automate tedious tasks. I have plenty of experiences with these tasks and being able to use computers in new and 
challenging ways has kept me in front of the screen, though I do appreciate the extra time for nature walks around the neighborhood.

I am taking the next step in my professional life as a challenge to myself and a committment to the growth of the technological ecosystem.
Society is becoming more technical with trends changing and data collection of trends changing by the day. I take responsibility to use 
technology for the greater good of the world. Technology has changed my life by ways of how I view and solve problems. It has also been a
way to connect with familiar people and strangers. I hope you reading this has had unimaginable experiences with technology.

In closing, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to seeing you on the "streets" of GitHub!
